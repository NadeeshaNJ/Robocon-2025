# 🤖 ABU Robocon 2025 – Basketball Robots

Welcome to the official repository for our **ABU Robocon 2025** project! This year’s challenge, organized by the **Asia-Pacific Broadcasting Union (ABU)**, tasks teams with building **two autonomous basketball-playing robots** capable of passing, shooting, rotating, and navigating the court.

## 🏀 Project Overview

Our robots are designed to compete in a dynamic basketball-themed game. Each robot is equipped with mechanisms to:
- **Pass** the ball between teammates
- **Shoot** into designated hoops
- **Rotate** for strategic positioning
- **Move** across the court with precision

## 🧠 Tech Stack

### Software
- **Arduino**: Core logic and motor control
- **ROS (Robot Operating System)**: Pub/Sub architecture for modular communication
- **Flutter**: To create the app for controlling the robot via wifi

### Hardware
- **ESP32**: Primary microcontroller for both robots
- **Custom-built chassis** with actuators and sensors
- **Wireless communication** for real-time control and feedback

## 📱 Control System

Our mobile app allows users to:
- Send movement and action commands
- Monitor robot status
- Switch between autonomous and manual modes
